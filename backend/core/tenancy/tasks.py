    Async task completing self-serve tenant signup: creates the default
    "Main Office" shop and the tenant's first admin user, once the tenant's
    database is ready.

    admin_username/first_name/last_name are optional because different
    signup flows collect different fields - callers that only have an email
    (no separate username) can omit admin_username and it falls back to
    tenant.email.

    acks_late=True matters more here than on the other tasks: this task
    carries the admin_password_hash as an argument, which exists nowhere
    else (deliberately never persisted on the Tenant row). If the worker
    died mid-task with acks_late=False, that hash would be gone forever and
    the tenant would be stuck at 'db_ready' with no way to ever create its
    admin user - the subdomain is already taken, so the user couldn't even
    sign up again. With acks_late=True the broker redelivers the same
    message, hash included, to another worker. This is safe only because
    the shop/user creation below is now idempotent (get_or_create /
    existence-checked) - a redelivered task may run this body more than
    once against a partially-completed prior attempt.

    Dispatched independently of (and concurrently with)
    setup_tenant_database_async, so this retries with backoff until it sees
    setup_status == 'db_ready' rather than assuming ordering. Sets
